### This is my repo for my 2 week program at umass amherst

## Documentation for my multimeter project

For this project I knew I needed to use the analog pins on the Arduino to detect the voltage and I also wanted to use an oled display to display the voltage. I also knew I wanted a way for the user to choose the mode, similar to other multimeters. To do this I ended up using a potentiometer.

When I did research on this project I couldnt find anything similar that used the Arduino UNO, but I did see simple projects that either just tested continuity or just measured voltage. 

To start brainstorming, I just started messing around with using an led to show when a circuit was completed to show continuity. I also set up a digital input pin to read the circuit also.
